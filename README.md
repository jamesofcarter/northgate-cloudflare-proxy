  <h1>MonetizationOS Cloudflare Proxy</h1>
</div>

[MonetizationOS](https://monetizationos.com) powers monetization for human and bot users alike. Use this Cloudflare Worker to proxy your website and integrate MonetizationOS Surfaces, enabling seamless monetization experiences for sites served with static HTML.

This worker includes handling for both HTTP response modification and CSS-targeted Components for content modifications including: removal/truncation, displaying offerings, and custom messaging.

Read more about using MonetizationOS at [docs.monetizationos.com](https://docs.monetizationos.com).

## Getting Started

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/MonetizationOS/cloudflare-proxy-worker)

Click deploy to Cloudflare to get started or fork this repo to customize it for your needs.

## Required Variables

This worker requires the following environment variables to be set in your Cloudflare configuration:

-   `MONETIZATION_OS_SECRET_KEY`: Your MonetizationOS secret key. [Get your secret key](https://docs.monetizationos.com/docs/guides/environments/managing-environments#api-keys).
-   `ORIGIN_URL`: The origin URL for your proxied website.
-   `SURFACE_SLUG`: The slug for the MonetizationOS surface you want to target.
-   `AUTHENTICATED_USER_JWT_COOKIE_NAME`: Cookie name for authenticated user JWT sessions.
-   `ANONYMOUS_SESSION_COOKIE_NAME`: Cookie name for anonymous sessions.

Bindings should be set in your `wrangler.jsonc`, or a `.dev.vars.local` file when [working locally](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/development-testing/).

## Optional: headers sent to the origin

`ORIGIN_REQUEST_HEADERS` adds or overrides outgoing headers on every upstream fetch to `ORIGIN_URL`. Set it to a JSON object mapping header names to values. Leave it as `{}` when no extra headers are needed.

In `wrangler.jsonc` `vars`:

```jsonc
"ORIGIN_REQUEST_HEADERS": { "X-Api-Key": "secret", "X-Custom": "my-value" }
```

In the Cloudflare dashboard, the variable supports JSON input directly.
